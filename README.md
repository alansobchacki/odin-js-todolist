Project: To-Do List
=============

A basic to-do list tracker app.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-js-todolist/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the fourth project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [4/12].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Your todo-items are going to have: a title, description, dueDate and priority. Notes and a checklist are optional.
- [x] Your todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos.
- [x] Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.
- [x] Separate your application logic from the DOM-related stuff.
- [x] The user interface must allow users to: view all projects, view all tasks in each project, edit a task details, and delete a task/project.
- [x] Users should be able to save their data on their local machine.

What I Learned
-----

This one looked simple, but was a bit trickier than imagined. I learned about try...catch statements and the basics of the Web Storage API. Not to mention, of course, how I practiced a bunch with DOM manipulation, arrays, and CSS grid/flexbox. A fun project, for sure!
